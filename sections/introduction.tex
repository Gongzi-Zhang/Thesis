\subsection{symmetry energy} 
% what's symmetry energy

% how to know/measure it -- theoritically and experimentally
It has long been a hot topic for nuclear scientists to study how the asymmetry 
between number of proton and nucleon will affect nuclei, especially the binding
energy, which hints us the limit of new isotope elements. Using the simplest 
liquid drop model, we will get the Bethe-Weizsacker Semi-empirical Mass Foumula:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:mass-foumula}
    \begin{gathered}
	E\ (MeV) = \textcolor{black}{a_V A} - \textcolor{blue}{a_S A^{2/3}} - \textcolor{green}{a_C\frac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{1/3}}} - \textcolor{red}{a_A\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A}} + \textcolor{cyan}{\delta(A, Z)} + \dots \\
	\delta(A, Z) = 
	    \begin{cases}
		+\delta_0	& \text{Z, N even} \\
		0		& \text{A odd}	\\
		-\delta_0	& \text{Z, N odd (A even)} \\
	    \end{cases}
    \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
    \color{black} \item Volume term: nucleons attract nearest neighbors 
	through strong force ($a_V \sim 16\ MeV$)
    \color{blue}  \item Surface term: correction to the volume term -- nucleons 
	on the surface aren't completely surrounded by other nucleons
    \color{green} \item Coulomb term: electromagnetic (EM) charge repulsion
    \color{red}   \item Asymmetry term: Pauli exclusion principle
    \color{cyan}  \item Pairing term: spin coupling effect -- if N and Z are even,
	then the nuclei will be stable thanks to the occurance of 'paired spin';
	on the other hand, nuclei with odd number of proton and neutron are usually
	unstable. ($\delta_0 \sim 1\ MeV$, slowly decreasing with A)
\end{itemize}

The first 3 terms are natural and easy to understand, while the 4th term is 
not so obvious. It is based only on Pauli exclusion principle. In heavy nuclei,
more neutrons than protons are needed to balance the repulsion between protons.
Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, these extra neutrons' energy will be 
higher than the rest of nucleons, therefore introducing this correction term.

For a general discussion, we can ignore the 3rd term to focus on the homogeneous
nuclear (residual strong) interaction between nucleons, and the 5th term which is too small.
Now, we can talk about any nuclear system composed of Z protons (EM charge-less) 
and N neutrons, rather than just true nuclei. Now we have a simplified equation
of state (EoS) for nuclear matter:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:modified-mass-formula}
    \begin{aligned}
	E &= a_V A - a_S A^{2/3} - a_A\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A}  \\
	e &= \frac{E}{A} = a_V - a_S A^{-1/3} - a_A\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A^2} = E_0(A) - a_A\left(\frac{N-Z}{A}\right)^2 
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We can see that the binding energy depends on two variables, N and Z; or N+Z (A)
and N-Z. If we fix A, then $e$ will be a solely function of N-Z, or conventionally
$\beta = (N-Z)/A$. $\beta$ characterizes the asymmetry between the number of 
protons and neutrons. Again, for the purpose of generalization, we will replace
N, Z and A with their corresponding density: $\rho_n$, $\rho_p$ and $\rho$
($\beta = \frac{\rho_n - \rho_p}{\rho}$). 
So we are considering a uniform nuclear system at 0 temperature that interacts
only via the nuclear force.
Rewrite eq \eqref{eq:modified-mass-formula}:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:symmetry-energy}
    e(\rho, \beta) = e(\rho, 0) + S(\rho)\beta^2 + O(\beta^4)
\end{equation}

This is the expansion of the binding energy per nucleon around $\beta = 0$.
Due to the isospin symmetry between proton and neutron, any isoscalar quantities
F will keep unchanged under $n \leftrightarrow p$ interchange, while isovector 
% change all n into p and p into n. Not just one proton and one neutron
quantities G will change sign. $\beta$ is a isovector, so for a smooth $F(\beta)$,
its expansion around $\beta = 0$ has even terms only:
$$ F(\beta) = F_0 + F_2\beta^2 + F_4\beta^4 + \dots $$
On the other hand, for a smooth $G(\beta)$, its expansion around $\beta = 0$ has
odd terms only:
$$ G(\beta) = G_1\beta + G_3\beta^3 + \dots $$

e is an isoscalar, it doesn't change under $n \leftrightarrow p$ interchange 
as we can see from eq \eqref{eq:modified-mass-formula}. The coefficient $S(\rho)$ is
what we call the \textbf{symmetry energy}, a key parameter in explaining a wide
range of nuclear properties and phenomena. It describes how much energy is needed
to exchange all protons into neutrons for a symmetric nuclear matter. Take 
neutron star \ref{Lattimer.2001} as an example, it has most neutrons and a few 
protons, so its $\beta = 1$.
$$ E = E_0 + S $$
$$ P = \rho^2 \frac{dS}{d\rho} \approx \frac{L\rho^2}{3\rho_0} $$
$$ RP^{-1/4} \approx const $$
Once we know symmetry energy's dependence on density, we will know the pressure
and therefore the radius of a neutron star.

Being such an important parameter, a great effort has been done to extract S 
and its dependence on $\rho$. By convention, $S(\rho)$ is expanded around the
nuclear saturation density $\rho_0$:
\begin{equation}
    S(\rho) = S(\rho_0) 
    + \left.\frac{dS}{d\rho}\right|_{\rho_0}(\rho - \rho_0)
    + \frac{1}{2}\left.\frac{d^2S}{d\rho^2}\right|_{\rho_0}(\rho - \rho_0)^2
    + \frac{1}{6}\left.\frac{d^3S}{d\rho^3}\right|_{\rho_0}(\rho - \rho_0)^3
    + \dots
\end{equation}
From which, we have some other parameters defined:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
	S_0 &= S(\rho_0)	\\
	L   &= 3\rho_0\left.\frac{dS}{d\rho}\right|_{\rho_0}	\\
	K_{sym}	&= 9\rho_0^2\left.\frac{d^2S}{d\rho^2}\right|_{\rho_0}	\\
	Q_{sym}	&= 27\rho_0^3\left.\frac{d^3S}{d\rho^3}\right|_{\rho_0}	\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$ S(\rho) = -a_A + \frac{L}{3}\frac{\rho - \rho_0}{\rho_0} $$


% \begin{equation}
%     \begin{aligned}
% 	\frac{E_b}{A} &= -B + \frac{K_0}{18}\left(\frac{n}{n_s} - 1\right)^2 + \frac{K'_0}{162}\left(\frac{n}{n_s} - 1\right)^3 \\
% 	    &+ \left[S_v + \frac{n_s}{3n}L\left(\frac{n}{n_s} - 1 \right) + \dots \right] \left(\frac{N-Z}{A} \right)^2 + \dots
%     \end{aligned}
% \end{equation}
For symmetric nuclei (N = Z), 
While neutron-rich nuclei, the extra nutrons are
pushed out against the surface tension\cite{PRL.85.5296}, therefore the neutron skin.

% \begin
There has been many measurements (!!!FIXME!!!) about the charge form factor of many elements,
but rarely any precise measurement of the weak form factor of any elements.
The Pb Radius EXperiment-II (PREX-II) and Ca48 Radius EXperiment (CREX) are 
high-precision experiments that measures the tiny asymmetry of polarized electrons
scattered from neutron-rich targets to extract the weak form factor and neutron
skin thickness of those nuclei. 


With the high-polarization electron beam at 
Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF, also known as Jlab), 
we were able to measure the asymmetry precisely. 
The cross section asymmetry comes from the interference between 
the electromagnetic (EM) interaction and the weak interaction. While the EM 
cross section has been studied thoroughly, (!!!FIXME!!!: reference) the asymmetry 
measurement allows us to derive the weak charge distribution and finally the
neutron distribution in a nuclear.

The neutron skin of heavy nuclei and neutron stars, though of their 18 orders of 
magnitude difference in size (fm vs km), both are neutron-rich matter and thereby
governed by the same physical laws: the nuclear equation of state. 
The measurement of neutron radius of neutron-rich nuclei will constrain 
the density dependence of the symmetry energy for neutron-rich matter,
(!!!FIXME: reference)
it helps to identify the Equation of State (EoS) of neutron stars.

There have been many explorations from different aspects to the neutron skin
thickness: hadronic scattering experiment, coherent pion photoproduction,
measurements of electric dipole polarizabilities and pygmy dipole resonances etc.
Though of their valuable efforts, these experiments are trapped by model 
dependence and other uncertainties.

    \CA_{pv} = \frac{\frac{d\sigma^R}{d\Omega} - \frac{d\sigma^L}{d\Omega}}{\frac{d\sigma^R}{d\Omega} + \frac{d\sigma^L}{d\Omega}} = \frac{|\CM^R|^2 - |\CM^L|^2}{|\CM^R|^2 + |\CM^L|^2}
\end{equation*}
where: $\CM^{R, L} = \CM_{\gamma} + \CM_Z^{R,L}$

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
	|\CM^{R,L}|^2 &= |\CM_\gamma|^2 + \CM_\gamma\CM_Z^{R,L*} + \CM_\gamma^*\CM_Z^{R,L} + |\CM^{R,L}|^2	\\
	|\CM^{R}|^2 - |\CM^{L}|^2 &= \CM_\gamma( \CM_Z^{R*} - \CM_Z^{L*} + \CM_Z^{R} - \CM_Z^L) \\
	&\approx 2\CM_\gamma(\CM_Z^R - \CM_Z^L)
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}


\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
	\CA_{pv}\footnotemark &\approx \frac{\CM_Z^R - \CM_Z^L}{\CM_\gamma} \propto \frac{\frac{d\sigma_{\text{weak}}}{d\Omega}}{\frac{d\sigma_{\text{E+M}}}{d\Omega}}	\\
	    &\approx \frac{G_F Q^2}{4\pi\alpha\sqrt{2}} \frac{Q_{wk}}{Z}\frac{F_{wk}(Q^2)}{F_{ch}(Q^2)}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
	F_{ch}(q) &= G_{ch}^p(q)F_p(q) + G_{ch}^n(q)F_n(q)  \\

	F_{wk}(q) &= G_{wk}^p(q)F_p(q) + G_{wk}^n(q)F_n(q)  \\
		  &= G_E^p(q)\left[ F_n(q) - \frac{Z}{N}(1-4\sin^2\theta_W)F_p(q)\right] - G_E^n(q)\left[ F_n(q)(1-4\sin^2\theta_W) - \frac{Z}{N}F_p(q)\right]
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Where $G_E^p(q)$ and $G_E^n(q)$ are the EW single nucleon FFs, $\sin^2\theta_W = 0.23$ is the Weinberg angle, $F_p(q)$ and $F_n(q)$ are the FFs of point proton and neutron density dist. Compared with $G_E^p(q)$, the charge FF of the neutron $G_E^n(q)$ can be neglected for small momentum transfer:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
	F_p(q) &= \int d^3r j_0(qr) \rho_p(r)	\\
	F_n(q) &= \int d^3r j_0(qr) \rho_n(r)	\\
	G_{wk}^p &= q_p G_E^p + q_n G_E^n + q_0 G_E^s	\\
	G_{wk}^n &= q_p G_E^p + q_n G_E^n + q_0 G_E^s	\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
For weak charges including radiative cor.
$$ q_p \approx 0.0712	\qquad q_n = q_0 \approx -0.9877 $$
$$ \frac{F_{wk}(q)}{F_{ch}(q)} \approx \frac{F_n(q)}{F_p(q)}$$
$$ \CA_{pv} = \frac{G_FQ^2}{4\pi\alpha\sqrt{2}}\frac{Q_{wk}}{Z}\left[ \frac{F_n(q)}{F_p(q)} - \frac{Z}{N}(1-4\sin^2\theta_W) \right]$$
where: $F(Q^2) = \int d^3r \frac{sin(Qr)}{Qr}\rho(r)$
\begin{equation*}
    \rho(\vec{r}) = Q^{N}\rho_N(\vec{r}) + Q^{P}\rho_P(\vec{r})
\end{equation*}
In general use model for $\rho(\vec{r})$, example: Wood-Saxon form:
\begin{equation*}
    \rho(r) = \frac{\rho_0}{1 + exp[(r-R)/a]}
\end{equation*}
where R is the radius of the density $\rho(r)$?

4-Momentum conservation 
$$ E_0 + M = E' + E \qquad \vec{p}_0 = \vec{p}' + \vec{p} $$
Assume ($m_e << 0 \Rightarrow E_0 \approx p_0, E' \approx p'$)
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
	E^2 &= M^2 + \vec{p}^2 = M^2 + (\vec{p}_0 - \vec{p}')^2  \\
	    &= M^2 + (E_0 - E'\cos\theta)^2 + (E'\sin\theta)^2	\\
