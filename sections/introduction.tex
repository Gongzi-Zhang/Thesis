\chapter{Introduction}

The Pb Radius EXperiment-II (PREX-II) and Ca48 Radius EXperiment (CREX) are 
high-precision experiments that measure the tiny parity-violating asymmetry 
(at part per billion (ppb) level) of longitudinally polarized electrons scattered 
off neutron-rich targets (\Pb \ and \Ca), from which the weak form factors and 
neutron skin thicknesses of those nuclei will be extracted.

The parity-violating asymmetry ($\CA_{pv}$) comes from the interference between the 
electromagnetic (EM) interaction and the neutral weak interaction, because weak 
interaction doesn't conserve the parity symmetry. While the EM 
interaction has been studied thoroughly, the asymmetry measurement allows 
us to derive the weak charge and therefore the neutron distribution in a nucleus.

Parity-violating electron scattering (PVES) experiments require high polarization
electron beam, which was provided by the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator
Facility (CEBAF) at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF, 
also known as JLab). The excellent beam qualities and dedicated instrumentations
at JLab allowed the measurements to be statistics limited.

\section{Neutron Radius}
The proton (charge) Root-Mean-Square (RMS) radii ($R_p$) of many nuclei have been
precisely measured through atomic and nuclear experiments \cite{???}, but 
the community has few precise data about the neutron RMS radius ($R_n$), which is another 
important component in describing the structure of nuclei. The difficuties lie in that
neutrons are electricly chargeless, so one can measure its size only through weak
interaction or strong interaction. Both these 2 methods suffer from their own
limitations: the weak interaction is weak to measure while the strong interaction
has large uncertainty from the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Though of these
difficulties, there have been many effort from the community to explore the
different aspects of neutron radius (and neutron skin thickness): 
hadronic scattering experiment, coherent pion photoproduction,
measurements of electric dipole polarizabilities and pygmy dipole resonances etc.
Experimentally, the best resolution we got about $R_n$ is about 5\%. (FIXME)
Theorectically, The best estimates of Rn appear to come from nuclear theory, 
where models have been constrained primarily by data other than measurements 
of neutron radii. Therefore, a measurement of Rn will provide a powerful 
independent check of basic nuclear theory.

The nucleon RMS radius is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    R_{p, n} \equiv \langle R_{p,n}^2\rangle^{1/2} = \sqrt{\frac{\int d^3r\,r^2\,\rho_{p,n}(r)}{\int d^3r\,\rho_{p,n}(r)}}
    \label{eqn:rms_radius}
\end{equation}
where $\rho(r)$ is the nucleon density at radius r. 

Experimentally, we measure the nucleon RMS radius from their corresponding form
factors (FF). According to quantum mechanics, with Born approximation, the
matrix element (ME) for a scattering is (assuming a $1/r$ potential):
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
	\CM_{fi} &= \bra{\Psi_f}V(\vec{r})\ket{\Psi_i} 
		= \int e^{-i\vec{p}_f\vec{r}}V(\vec{r}) e^{i\vec{p}_i\vec{r}} d^3\vec{r}    \\	% 1
	    &= \int e^{i(\vec{p_i} - \vec{p_f})\vec{r}} d^3\vec{r} 
		\int \frac{\rho(\vec{r'})}{4\pi|\vec{r} - \vec{r'}|} d^3\vec{r'} \\	% 2
	    &= \int \int e^{i\vec{Q} \vec{r} } 
		 \frac{\rho(\vec{r'})}{4\pi|\vec{r} - \vec{r'}|} d^3\vec{r} d^3\vec{r'} \\	% 2
	    &= \int\int e^{i\vec{Q}(\vec{r} - \vec{r'})} 
		\frac{\rho(\vec{r'})}{4\pi|\vec{r} - \vec{r'}|} e^{i\vec{Q}\vec{r'}} d^3\vec{r} d^3\vec{r'}   \\  % 3
	    &= \int e^{i\vec{Q}\vec{R}} \frac{1}{4\pi|\vec{R}|} d^3\vec{R} 
		\int \rho(\vec{r'}) e^{i\vec{Q} \vec{r'}}d^3 \vec{r'}	\\  % 4
	    &= (\CM_{fi})_{\text{point}} F(\vec{Q^2})   \\	% 5
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
So the FF is:
\begin{equation}
    F(\vec{Q}^2) = \int \rho(\vec{r}) e^{i\vec{Q} \vec{r}} d^3\vec{r}
    \label{eqn:ff}
\end{equation}
which is just the Fourier transformation of nucleon distribution.
For a spherical potential, $\rho(\vec{r}) = \rho({|\vec{r}|}) = \rho(r)$:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
	F(\vec{Q}^2) &= \int \rho(r) e^{iQr\cos\theta} 2\pi r^2 \sin\theta dr d\theta	\\
	    &= 4\pi \int r \rho(r) \frac{\sin{(Qr)}}{Q} dr
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
At the small
$\vec{Q}^2$ limitation, we can do the Fourier expansion:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
	F(\vec{Q}^2) &= 4\pi \int r \rho(r) \frac{\sin{(Qr)}}{Q} dr \\
	    &= 4\pi \int \rho(r) r \left( r - \frac{1}{6} Q^2r^3 + \cdots \right) dr	\\
	    &= \int \rho(r)  \left( 1 - \frac{1}{6} Q^2r + \cdots \right) 4\pi r^2 dr	\\
	    &= Q_t (1 - \frac{1}{6}Q^2\langle r^2 \rangle + \cdots) \\
	    &= F(0) + \left.\frac{dF}{dQ^2}\right|_{Q^2=0} \times Q^2 + \cdots	\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where $Q_t = \int \rho(r) d^3\vec{r}$ is the total charge.

\begin{equation}
    \langle R^2 \rangle = -6 \left. \frac{dF(Q^2)}{dQ^2} \right|_{Q^2 = 0}
\end{equation}
So we can measure the FF at some low $Q^2$ points, exrapolate them 
to $Q^2 = 0$, then the slope at $Q^2 = 0$ will be the RMS radius.

For charged proton, the FF will be the precisely measured EM FF:
\begin{equation}
    \langle R_p^2 \rangle = -6 \left. \frac{dF_{EM}(Q^2)}{dQ^2} \right|_{Q^2 = 0}
\end{equation}
While neutron is neutral, we will measure its RMS radius from its weak charge
distribution:
\begin{equation}
    \langle R_n^2 \rangle = -6 \left. \frac{dF_{weak}(Q^2)}{dQ^2} \right|_{Q^2 = 0}
\end{equation}

\section{symmetry Energy} 
% what's symmetry energy
% why it is important
% how to know/measure it -- theoritically and experimentally
It has long been a hot topic for nuclear scientists to study how the asymmetry 
between number of proton and nucleon will affect nuclei, especially the binding
energy, which hints us the limit of new isotope elements. Using the simplest 
Liquid Drop Model (LDM), we will get the Bethe-Weizsacker Semi-empirical Mass Foumula:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:mass-foumula}
    \begin{gathered}
	E\ (MeV) = \textcolor{black}{a_V A} 
	    - \textcolor{blue}{a_S A^{2/3}} 
	    - \textcolor{green}{a_C\frac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{1/3}}} 
	    - \textcolor{red}{a_A\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A}} 
	    + \textcolor{cyan}{\delta(A, Z)} \\
	\delta(A, Z) = 
	    \begin{cases}
		+\delta_0	& \text{Z, N even} \\
		0		& \text{A odd}	\\
		-\delta_0	& \text{Z, N odd (A even)} \\
	    \end{cases}
    \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
    \color{black} \item Volume term: nucleons attract nearest neighbors 
	through strong force ($a_V \sim 16\ MeV$)
    \color{blue}  \item Surface term: correction to the volume term -- nucleons 
	on the surface aren't completely surrounded by other nucleons
    \color{green} \item Coulomb term: EM charge repulsion
    \color{red}   \item Asymmetry term: Pauli exclusion principle
    \color{cyan}  \item Pairing term: spin coupling effect -- if N and Z are even,
	then the nuclei will be stable thanks to the occurance of 'paired spin';
	on the other hand, nuclei with odd number of proton and neutron are usually
	unstable. ($\delta_0 \sim 1\ MeV$, slowly decreasing with A)
\end{itemize}

The first 3 terms are natural and easy to understand, while the 4th term is 
not so obvious. It is based only on Pauli exclusion principle. In heavy nuclei,
more neutrons than protons are needed to balance the repulsion between protons.
Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, these extra neutrons' energy will be 
higher than the rest of nucleons, therefore introducing this correction term.

Regard the nuclear system as a free Fermi gas of protons and neutrons, then the 
kinematic energy of this system will be:
$$ E_k = E_N + E_Z = \frac{3}{5}ZE_F^p + \frac{3}{5}NE_F^n $$
Since the Fermi energy is proportional to $n^{2/3}$
$$ E_k = C(Z^{5/3} + N^{5/3})  $$
Expanse it in terms of N-Z, we will get
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
	E_k &= 2^{-2/3}C\left(A^{5/3} + \frac{5}{9}\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A^{1/3}} \right) + O((N-Z)^4) \\
	    &= \frac{3}{5} E_F A + \frac{1}{3}E_F\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A} + O((N-Z)^4) \\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
The first term contributes to the volume term and the second term is minus the 
asymmetry term because $E_k$ contributes to the binding energy negatively.

For a general discussion, we can ignore the 3rd term to focus on the homogeneous
nuclear (residual strong) interaction between nucleons, and the 5th term which is too small.
Now, we can talk about any nuclear system composed of Z protons (EM charge-less) 
and N neutrons, rather than just true nuclei. Now we have a simplified equation
of state (EoS) for nuclear matter:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:modified-mass-formula-1}
    \begin{aligned}
	E &= a_V A - a_S A^{2/3} - a_A\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A}  \\
	e &= \frac{E}{A} = a_V - a_S A^{-1/3} - a_A\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A^2}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Actually, we should also discard the second term. Obviously, we can't guarantee
any specific shape about the nuclear system; what's mroe, for what people model
with most -- the infinite nuclear system, we don't need to consider the surface 
term at all.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:modified-mass-formula-2}
    \begin{aligned}
	E &= a_V A - a_A\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A}  \\
	e &= \frac{E}{A} = a_V - a_A\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A^2} = e_0(A) - a_A\beta^2 
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Here we define $\beta = \frac{N-Z}{A}$ as asymmetry between the number of protons and neutrons. 

For infinite system, density, instead of A, will be a better choice to parameterize
the EoS. So we should replace N, Z and A with their corresponding density: $\rho_n$, 
$\rho_p$ and $\rho$ ($\beta = \frac{\rho_n - \rho_p}{\rho}$). 
So we are considering an infinite uniform nuclear system at 0 temperature that interacts
only via the nuclear force. For any identified $\rho$,
eq \eqref{eq:modified-mass-formula-2} will be:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:symmetry-energy}
    e(\rho, \beta) = e(\rho, 0) + S(\rho)\beta^2 + O(\beta^4)
\end{equation}

This is an expansion of the binding energy per nucleon around $\beta = 0$.
Due to the isospin symmetry between proton and neutron, any isoscalar quantities
F will keep unchanged under $n \leftrightarrow p$ interchange, while isovector 
% change all n into p and p into n. Not just one proton and one neutron
quantities G will change sign. $\beta$ is an isovector, so for a smooth $F(\beta)$,
its expansion around $\beta = 0$ has even terms only:
$$ F(\beta) = F_0 + F_2\beta^2 + F_4\beta^4 + \dots $$
On the other hand, for a smooth $G(\beta)$, its expansion around $\beta = 0$ has
odd terms only:
$$ G(\beta) = G_1\beta + G_3\beta^3 + \dots $$

e is an isoscalar, it doesn't change under $n \leftrightarrow p$ interchange 
as we can see from eq \eqref{eq:modified-mass-formula-2}. The coefficient 
$S(\rho) = \frac{\partial^2 e (\rho, \beta)}{\partial \beta^2}$ is
what we call the \textbf{symmetry energy}, a key parameter in explaining a wide
range of nuclear properties and phenomena. It describes how much energy will be
released when exchange all protons into neutrons for a symmetric nuclear system. 

Not only is $S$ itself important, but also its dependence on $\rho$. 
By convention, $S(\rho)$ is expanded around the nuclear saturation density $\rho_0$
(following the free Fermi gas assumption):
\begin{equation}
    S(\rho) = S(\rho_0) 
    + \left.\frac{dS}{d\rho}\right|_{\rho_0}(\rho - \rho_0)
    + \frac{1}{2}\left.\frac{d^2S}{d\rho^2}\right|_{\rho_0}(\rho - \rho_0)^2
    + \frac{1}{6}\left.\frac{d^3S}{d\rho^3}\right|_{\rho_0}(\rho - \rho_0)^3
    + \dots
\end{equation}
From which, we have some auxiliary parameters defined:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
	S_0 &= S(\rho_0)	\\
	L   &= 3\rho_0\left.\frac{dS}{d\rho}\right|_{\rho_0}	\\
	K_{sym}	&= 9\rho_0^2\left.\frac{d^2S}{d\rho^2}\right|_{\rho_0}	\\
	Q_{sym}	&= 27\rho_0^3\left.\frac{d^3S}{d\rho^3}\right|_{\rho_0}	\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Among them, L represents S's dependence on $\rho$.

Take neutron star \cite{Lattimer.2001} as an example, it has most neutrons and 
a few protons, so its $\beta = 1$.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:neutron-star}
    \begin{aligned}
	 E = E_0 + S	\\
	 P = \rho^2 \frac{dS}{d\rho} \approx \frac{L\rho^2}{3\rho_0}	\\
	 RP^{-1/4} \approx const    \\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The amazing thing is that neutron star's pressure dependents on L is proportional
to $R^4$. Once we know the L value, we will know the pressure and therefore the 
radius of a neutron star. % (Do all neutron stars have the same $\rho$ and R ???)

Being such an important parameter, a great effort has been done to extract S 
and L. Comparing \eqref{eq:modified-mass-formula-2} and \eqref{eq:symmetry-energy},
we can directly get:
\begin{equation}
    S(\rho) \approx -a_A
% S(\rho) = -a_A + \frac{L}{3}\frac{\rho - \rho_0}{\rho_0}
\end{equation}
But this tells us only the symmetry energy at nuclear density ($1.22 \times 10^{44}\ m^{-3}$),
what about the symmetry energy at other density values? Especially at the nuclear
saturation density ($\sim 1.7 \times 10^{44}\ m^{-3}$)? And what about its density
dependence? Another strategy is the energy density functionals (EDF), which fits
the binding energy throughout the nuclear mass table to find out the best EDF,
then use it to calculate $S(\rho)$. The problem is many EDFs can fit equally well
with the binding energy and even the same S value at $\rho_0$, but have quite 
different L values. If there is a experiment that can identify L value without 
model dependence, then no doubt it will help a lot in understanding the symmetry 
energy and the EoS.
% experiments that measure L

% neutron skin
The method to measure L in lab is to measure the neutron skin thickness of 
neutron rich nuclei. For symmetric nuclei (N = Z), the protons and neutrons are
expected to distribute uniformly. While for neutron-rich nuclei, the extra 
neutrons are pushed out against the surface tension\cite{PRL.85.5296}, therefore
forming a neutron skin. 

Neutron skin and neutron star, though of their 18 orders of magnitude difference 
in size (fm vs km), both are neutron-rich nuclear matter and governed by the 
same physical laws: eq \eqref{eq:neutron-star}. So by measuring the neutron
skin thickness, we can derive P and L values, for the study of neutron stars
and nuclear EoS.

Where $G_E^p(q)$ and $G_E^n(q)$ are the EW single nucleon FFs, $\sin^2\theta_W = 0.23$ is the Weinberg angle, $F_p(q)$ and $F_n(q)$ are the FFs of point proton and neutron density dist. Compared with $G_E^p(q)$, the charge FF of the neutron $G_E^n(q)$ can be neglected for small momentum transfer:

Theoretically, there are a few methods to calculate the proton and neutron distribution
inside a nucleus, namely ab-initio and density functional theory (DFT). Both
methods works well in their own areas: ab-initio is suitable for describing  
light nuclei and DFT is good at calculating heavy nuclei. Unfortunately, we 
don't have a single complete theory that can predict for all nuclei. The medium
nucleus Ca, as shown in fig. \ref{fig:nuclear_landscape}, is accessible from both
ab-initio and DFT. By measuring the neutron skin thickness of \Ca, we hope to 
provides a possibility to bridge these two methods. As for \Pb, that's based on
PREX-I, that's why the name PREX-II.
