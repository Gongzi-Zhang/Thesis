\chapter{Transverse Asymmetry}
The Beam Normal Single Spin Asymmetry (BNSSA, aka Transverse Single Spin Asymmetry
or Transverse Asymmetry) is different from the PV asymmetry, it is purely 
electromagnetic and therefore parity-conserving. It arises from the interference
between one-photon and two-photon exchange, which is sensitive to the imaginary
part of the two-photon exchange amplitude. Transverse asymmetry is time-odd.
