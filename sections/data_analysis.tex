\chapter{Data processing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item non-linearity from electronics read out: false asymmetry. PMT $\rightarrow$
	preamplifier $\rightarrow$ ADC
\end{itemize}

Data quality:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Beam excursion: data quality cuts are applied to remove unstable beam periods
	FIXME: a plot for beam excursion
\end{itemize}
