\chapter{Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{cha:systematic_uncertainties}

The systematic uncertainty control is a highlight of these two
high-precision experiments. To achieve a smaller systematic uncertainty, a
combination of the fast and slow helicity reversals are employed, which help
to cancel many systematic uncertainties brought by the accelerator to the
beam. Except the uncertainty from the machine, another important source
of the systematic uncertainty is the detection process, namely the 
acceptance function.

After removing the false asymmetry from the beam, we proceed to correction of the
background asymmetry, namely, the target contamination and the inelastic scattering,
as shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:background_correction}.
\begin{equation}
    \CA_{\text{PV}} = \frac{\CA_{\text{cor}}/\CP - \sum_i \CA_i f_i}{1 - \sum_i f_i}
    \label{eq:background_correction}
\end{equation}
Here, $i$ iterates through the background processes, $\CA_i$ and $f_i$ refer to 
the asymmetry and rate fraction of a background process. The rate fraction is defined
as:
\begin{equation}
    f_i = \frac{R_i}{\sum_i R_i + R_{Pb208}}
\end{equation}
with $R$ being the scattering rate.
In PREX-II, contamination from the diamond foils contributes the largest 
background correction.

Following the uncertainty propagation formula, the systematic uncertainty of
$\CA_{\text{PV}}$ is:
\begin{equation}
    (\delta \CA_{\text{PV}})^2 = 
      \left( \frac{\partial \CA_{\text{PV}}}{\partial \CA_{\text{cor}}} \delta \CA_{\text{cor}} \right)^2
      + \left( \frac{\partial \CA_{\text{PV}}}{\partial \CP} \delta \CP \right)^2
      + \sum_i \left[ \left(\frac{\partial \CA_{\text{PV}}}{\partial \CA_i}\delta \CA_i \right)^2 
	 + \left(\frac{\partial \CA_{\text{PV}}}{\partial f_i}\delta f_i \right)^2 \right]
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \CA_{\text{PV}}}{\partial \CA_j} = -\frac{f_j}{1 - \sum_i f_i}  \qquad
    \frac{\partial \CA_{\text{PV}}}{\partial f_j} = \frac{\CA_{\text{PV}} - \CA_j}{1 - \sum_i f_i}
    \label{eq:systematic_uncertainty}
\end{equation}

\section{$Q^2$ and $\theta$}
Physical interpretation of $\CA_{\text{PV}}$ requires the precise knowledge
of the scattering angle and corresponding $Q^2$, which are determined using
a watercell target.

    Plot from Siyu.}
    \label{fig:watercell}
    % HRS_optics_siyu
\end{figure}
As shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:scattered_energy}, the energy difference between the
two elastic peaks of ${}^1$H and ${}^{16}$O is:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta E' = E'_O - E'_H = E\left( \frac{1}{1 + \frac{E(1-\cos\theta)}{M_O}} -
    \frac{1}{1 + \frac{E(1-\cos\theta)}{M_H}} \right)
\end{equation}

By reconstructing the momentum distribution from the watercell target, as shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:watercell}, the peak energy difference and therefore the 
scattering angle can be extracted.
The advantage of the watercell target, compared with the production target,
is that the energy difference between the two elastic peaks cancels
many uncertainties due to the electron detection and trajectory reconstruction, 
therefore being more precise.

\section{Carbon Contamination in PREX-II}
% prex_target_subassy_revB.pdf
As discussed in Chapter 2, the low thermal conductivity of the \Pb foil limits
the highest beam current we can apply. With the pure \Pb foil, it will melt at 
$\sim 10 \ \mu$A. With the help of the surrounding diamond foils, the
\Pb target could tolerate up to $\gtrsim 100\ \mu $A. Besides, \Carbon is an isoscalar, 
and spin-0 nucleus, whose PV asymmetry is well-measured, so the background is	% FIXME C PV asymmetry
well understood. 

In terms of the \Ca target in CREX, without the need of the auxiliary materials,
the contamination mainly come from \ca, which is also an isoscalar
and spin-0 nucleus, so the background is benign.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Target Thickness}
The \Pb foil is 0.5~mm thick, the upstream and downstream diamond foils 
have thicknesses of half the \Pb foil, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:target_thickness}.

% https://prex.jlab.org/DocDB/0004/000446/001/target_thickness_errors.txt
The thickness of the target foils are measured in different ways. The diamond foil 
is measured directly using calipers with an accuracy of 0.0005~in (0.0127~mm).
Given the thickness of diamond foils being 1~in (0.255~mm), an estimate of 5\% 
relative error is reasonable. Foil to foil variations are smaller than 5\% (the
largest variation is 3.6\%), as shown in Table~\ref{tab:target_thickness}.

As for the \Pb foil, its thickness (area density) is inferred from its mass ($m$)
and area ($A$):
\begin{equation}
    \rho t = \frac{m}{A}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ and $t$ being the density and thickness, respectively.
The area is calculated from the measurement of the four corners of the \Pb foil,
which means the resulted thickness is an average over the whole foil. While
the raster area doesn't occupy the whole foil, this is a source of the uncertainty. 
The small irregularity in the edge (corner) is another error source. 
With these considerations and taking into account the thickness variations 
from foil to foil (the largest variation being 3.8\%),
a conservative estimate of 5\% is used as the
relative uncertainty of the thickness of the \Pb foil.

\subsubsection{Simulation}
In the simulation, the \Pb foil thickness is set to 0.552~mm (628.176~mg/$\mathrm{cm}^2$), 
the upstream diamond foil 0.2554~mm (89.9008~mg/$\mathrm{cm}^2$) and the downstream diamond 
foil 0.2556~mm (89.9712~mg/$\mathrm{cm}^2$). The central point angle being $4.74^\circ$,
and the raster size is $6\ \mathrm{mm} \times 4\ \mathrm{mm}$. 
Only simple cuts are applied to the simulation, as shown in the following code
snippet.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=C]
    xcol != -333 && xvdc != -333    // collimator and vdc see the track
    && CollimatorL(xcol, ycol)	// Q1 collimator geometry cut
    && (nuclA == 12 || nuclA == 208)	// select only C or Pb208
    && Pz_peak- Pz < pcut	// radiative tail cut; cut only on lower side
\end{lstlisting}
where Pz is ihe post target electron momentum and Pz\_peak (948.97~MeV) 
is the momentum peak without the momentum cut; other cuts are explained in the
code block.

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{prex_C_contamination_P}
    \caption{Post target electron momentum distribution. The lower end tail comes 
    from multi-scattering and radiation.}
\end{figure}

With these cuts, we can count the scattering rate from \Carbon and \Pb directly 
and calculate the ratio between them, which is:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{R_C}{R_{Pb}} = 6.71\%	\qquad f_C = \frac{R_C}{R_C + R_{Pb}} = 6.29\%
\end{equation}

To study the systematic uncertainty, we varied the thickness of the \Pb and 
diamond foils (total thickness) by 5\% from the nominal value, and applied
different momentum cuts (varied from 1.8 to 2.6~MeV), the result is shown in
Table~\ref{tab:prex_C_contam_rate_thickness} and \ref{tab:prex_C_contam_rate_pcut}.

\end{landscape}

I am doubting if I was comparing the same thing. 
In data, $Q^2$ was calculated as:
$$ Q^2 = 2*beamE*P*(1-\cos(\theta))$$
where beamE was the average beam energy (before hitting the target), 
and P was the reconstructed beam energy, or post-target energy 
and $\theta$ was the reconstructed scattering angle 

But in simulation, $Q^2$ was calculated as:
$$ Q^2 = 2*E*Ef*(1-\cos(\theta)) $$
where E was the post vertex beam energy: I made a mistake here, E should be 
pre-vertex beam energy.
$$ Ef = M*E/(M + E*(1-cos(th))) $$
was the theorectical beam energy after elastic scattering and $\theta$ was 
the scattering angle.

Obviously, data and simulation had different definitions:
$$ beamE > E	\quad P < E	\quad P \stacker{?}{\sim} $$
The only good news was that beamE, E, P, Ef were all close to each other. Overall,
the simulation would make the simulation $Q^2$ smaller than that of data. Not
sure how large the uncertainty was.

The only difference here for vertex and post-vertex was the scattering angle,
one was the vertex angle and the other being the post-target scattering angle.

The CREX analysis was comparing the same thing.

Comparing the simulation $Q^2$ to that of the optics data in Table~\ref{tab:prex_C_contam_Q2}. 
We see a quite good agreement between the simulation and the data (left arm),
indicating the reliability of the simulation.
% For the right arm, the larger scattering angle caused a little difference in $Q^2$ (2\%).

\subsubsection{Cross Check of the Simulation}
Another cross check is done by comparing the simulation result with the 
theoretical prediction. Theoretically,
the scattering rate is proportional to the cross section and the number of atoms
in an unit area. 
\begin{equation}
    R \propto \sigma \times N = \sigma \times \frac{t}{m}
\end{equation}
here, t and m are, respectively, the area density (mass thickness) and atomic mass. 
Therefore:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{R_C}{R_{Pb}} = \frac{\sigma_C}{\sigma_{Pb}} \times \frac{t_c}{t_{Pb}} \times \frac{m_{Pb}}{m_C}
\end{equation}
Take $E = 0.95$~GeV and $\theta = 4.8^\circ$ (based on Table~\ref{tab:prex_C_contam_Q2}), 
the cross section for e-\Carbon and e-\Pb scatterings is numerically solved to be:
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_C = 48.001\ \mathrm{mbarn}	\qquad \sigma_{Pb} = 3386.100\ \mathrm{mbarn}	
\end{equation}
% this angle is different from what we used in simulation 4.74

The ratio of $t_C/t_{Pb}$ is calculated as:

As shown in Table~\ref{tab:theoretical_value}, the theoretical value is 4.6\% higher than the simulation result.

\subsubsection{Contribution to $\CA_{\text{PV}}$}
As said before, the asymmetry of the elastic electron-diamond scattering is well understood.
The cross section and asymmetry of e-\Carbon scattering at various energies 
and scattering angles are numerically solved from the Dirac equation by our 
theorist friends, and tabulated (Chuck's table). For \Pb, there is a similar table.
The asymmetry of e-\Carbon scattering is taken to be 539.36~ppb, as shown in 
Table~\ref{tab:prex_C_contam_sim}
with the nominal \Pb and nominal diamond thicknesses. The relative uncertainty is taken
to be a conservative estimae of 4\%.

    calculation. We see similar values between the two methods for both nuclei.}
    \label{fig:prex_asym}
\end{figure}

Using Eq.~\ref{eq:systematic_uncertainty}, the uncertainty contribution to $\CA_{\text{PV}}$
is calculated and summarized in Table~\ref{tab:prex_C_contam}.
\begin{equation}
    \begin{gathered}
	\frac{\partial \CA_{\text{PV}}}{\partial \CA_C} \delta \CA_C = 
	-\frac{0.0629}{1 - 0.0629} \times 4\% \times 539.36 = -1.4481\ \mathrm{ppb}   \\
	\frac{\partial \CA_{\text{PV}}}{\partial f_C}\delta f_C =

is also tiny, which in hindsight, justifies our adoption of the sandwich target.

\section{The CREX Acceptance Function}
As said before, the spectrometer acceptance is mainly defined by the Q1 
collimator, while other components may have some affections on it. The acceptance
is not tiny (0.00377~sr), points within the acceptance may have
different detection efficiencies and different asymmetries. In other words, 
what we measure is actually the average asymmetry over the acceptance:
\begin{equation}
    \CA_{\text{mea}} = \frac{\int d\theta \sin\theta \CA(\theta) \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} \epsilon(\theta)}{\int d\theta \sin\theta \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} \epsilon(\theta)}
    \label{eq:acceptance_function}
\end{equation}
here $\epsilon(\theta)$ is the acceptance function, which is defined as
the ratio of electrons that reach the main detector over all scattered
electrons. This quantity depends on the scattering angle $\theta$:
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon(\theta) = \frac{N_{\text{det}}(\theta)}{N_{\text{sca}}}
    \label{eq:acceptance_definition}
\end{equation}

From Eq.~\ref{eq:acceptance_function}, we see the importance of the acceptance
function. Firstly, it will contribute to the systematic uncertainty of $\CA_{\text{PV}}$;
secondly, only with the acceptance function, can we compare
the experimental measurement to theoretical predictions, to interpret our
results.

To extract the acceptance function, again, we have to turn to simulations. 
To ensure the reliability of the simulation result, precise matches of 
various kinematic variables between the simulation and the optics data are required. 

When we take the optics data, we can put in the sieve slit collimators.
By reconstructing electron trajectories with the track info from the VDCs 
and the hole positions in the sieve plane, the scattering angle and beam energy
can be inferred.

In terms of the simulation, we tuned some parameters to find out the best
match with data -- the best model, which was then used to calculate the acceptance
function. The three parameters we explored are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Septum current
    \item Q1 collimator shift
    \item Pinch point shift
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Transportation Matrix}
% http://home.bakingrpi.com/Data/CRex_2021DNP_Opt/
Due to the existence of various magnetic fields (septum, HRS) between the target 
and the detector, there is no way to know the analytical expression of the transportation
between them, though we can approximate and measure it.

An electron trajectory can be parameterized as: 
\begin{equation}
    \vec{X} = (x, \theta, y, \phi, \delta)^T
\end{equation}
w.r.t. to a reference trajectory (usually the central ray). In the transport coordinate, 
$\hat{z}$ is the moving direction of the reference trajectory;
x is the displacement in the dispersive plane relative to the reference 
trajectory, and $\theta$ is the `velocity' in the dispersive plane:
\begin{equation}
    \theta = \frac{\partial x}{\partial z}
\end{equation}
Similarly, y and $\phi$ are displacement and `velocity' in the y-z plane. 
\begin{equation}
    \phi = \frac{\partial y}{\partial z}
\end{equation}
$\hat{y}$ is oriented such that $\hat{x}$, $\hat{y}$, $\hat{z}$ are orthogonal 
to each other and they form a right-handed (RH) coordinate $\hat{z} = \hat{x} \times \hat{y}$.
\begin{equation}
    \delta = \frac{\Delta p}{p}
\end{equation}
represents the fractional deviation of momentum from that of the reference trajectory. 
With these definitions, the electron trajectory can be expressed
as the Fourier expansion of the initial state of $\vec{X}_0$:
\begin{equation}
    x_i = \sum_j T_{ij} x_{j,0} + \sum_j \sum_k S_{ijk} x_{j,0}x_{k, 0} + \cdots
    \label{eq:transportation}
\end{equation}
where $T_{ij}$ is what we call the transportation matrix, whose elements indicate
the reliance of the beam parameters on each other: 
\begin{equation}
    T_{ij} = \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial x_j}
\end{equation}
Considering the fact that electron trajectories will be very close to the 
reference trajectory, the first order expansion is good enough to approximate 
Eq.~\ref{eq:transportation}. So we write:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
	x   \\
	y   \\
	\theta	\\
	\phi	\\
	\delta	\\
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    T
    \begin{pmatrix}
	x_{tg}   \\
	y_{tg}   \\
	\theta_{tg}	\\
	\phi_{tg}	\\
	\delta_{tg}	\\
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
	x|x_{tg} & x|y_{tg}   & x|\theta_{tg}	& x|\phi_{tg}    & x|\delta_{tg}    \\
	y|x_{tg} & y|y_{tg}   & y|\theta_{tg}	& y|\phi_{tg}    & y|\delta_{tg}    \\
	\theta|x_{tg} & \theta|y_{tg}   & \theta|\theta_{tg}	& \theta|\phi_{tg}    & \theta|\delta_{tg}    \\
	\phi|x_{tg} & \phi|y_{tg}   & \phi|\theta_{tg}	& \phi|\phi_{tg}    & \phi|\delta_{tg}    \\
	\delta|x_{tg} & \delta|y_{tg}   & \delta|\theta_{tg}	& \delta|\phi_{tg}    & \delta|\delta_{tg}    \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
	x_{tg}   \\
	y_{tg}   \\
	\theta_{tg}	\\
	\phi_{tg}	\\
	\delta_{tg}	\\
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
The `tg' subscript refers to corresponding values on the target plane. 
With the transportation matrix, one can inverse it to propagate backward 
to calculate the electron state on the target plane, 
from what we detect with VDCs. Usually, we start from the focal plane $\vec{X}_{fp}$, 
then the electron state on the target plane will be: 
\begin{equation}
    \vec{X}_{tg} = T^{-1} \vec{X}_{fp}
    \label{eq:reconstruction}
\end{equation}
The reason that we don't use BPMs to `measure' the electron position/angle at 
the target is that multi-scattering/radiation inside the target foil will 
distort the electron trajectory. 

The typical HRS transportation plots are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:hrs_transport}:
\begin{figure}[!h]
    \includegraphics[width=0.50\linewidth]{hrs_transport_x}
    \includegraphics[width=0.48\linewidth]{hrs_transport_y}
    \caption{HRS transportation plot. 
    % One can clearly see the dispersive effect due to shift in momentum ($\delta$) in the Dipole area and the convergent effect of Q3.
    } % FIXME reference and more description
    \label{fig:hrs_transport}
\end{figure}

Actually, not every element of $T$ needs to be measured, some elements are obviously
0. E.g. $\delta$ should be not be changed by any magnetic field, so 
\begin{equation}
    T_{5i, i\ne 5} = 0
\end{equation}
The design of the HRS tells us that the dispersion depends only on $\delta$, but not
on $\theta$ or $\phi$, therefore 
\begin{equation}
    x|\theta = 0
\end{equation}
Different planes should not interfere with each other, which means 
\begin{equation}
    x|y = x|\phi = \theta|y = \theta|\phi = y|x = y|\theta = \phi|x = \phi|\theta = 0
\end{equation}
That is to say $T$ is a sparse matrix.

The transportation matrix is measured with the sieve data. 
When the sieve slit collimator is put in, the electron trajectories
from different holes are naturally separated on the focal plane, which allows
us to match them to the sieve holes one by one. With a reasonable initial value of 
the matrix (from previous experiments),
we could reconstruct the electron state on the sieve plane using Eq.~\ref{eq:reconstruction}.
By tuning the matrix elements, the one that minimizes the distance of the 
electron trajectory on the sieve plane from the closest hole center 
is identified as the transportation matrix. % This is a linear regression problem. 
The selection of the septum and HRS current is based on the sieve pattern 
derived from the transportation matrix.

\subsection{Scattering Angle $\theta_{\text{lab}}$}
The parameter that directly reflects the quality of the simulation is the scattering
angle. It is more convenient to use the target coordinate system (TCS) 
than the hall coordinate system (HCS) in simulation, though the comparison to
the data uses values in the lab frame (HCS). The two coordinate systems and the transportation
between them are defined below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hall coordinate system: originated at the center of the hall and
	cross the beam line.  $\hat{Z}$ is along the beam line, pointing downstream; 
	$\hat{Y}$ points up and $\hat{X}$ points left to form a RH coordinate system.
    \item Target coordinate system: which is the transport coordinate system at the target.
	$\hat{Z}$ is along the beam trajectory, pointing away the target, 
	$\hat{X}$ is on the dispersive plane and points down, $\hat{Y}$ is perpendicular
	to the dispersive plane and points away (toward) the beamline for LHRS (RHRS).
\end{itemize}

    \caption[HCS and TCS]
    {Schematic plot of the HCS and TCS. The hall center is the origin of 
    the HCS, but the target doesn't necessary lie in the hall center. The distance
    from the hall center to the sieve plane ($L$) is a constant, which is used to
    identify the origin of the TCS. In the ideal case, the origins of both coordinate
    systems will overlap.}
\end{figure}

The relationship between the HCS and TCS is:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
	x_{tg}	\\
	y_{tg}	\\
	z_{tg}	\\
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
	\cos(90^\circ)   & -\sin(90^\circ)    & 0	\\
	\sin(90^\circ)   & \cos(90^\circ)     & 0	\\
	0   & 0     & 1	\\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
	\cos(-\theta_0)	& 0 & -\sin(-\theta_0)  \\
	0		& 1 & 0		\\
	\sin(-\theta_0)	& 0 & \cos(-\theta_0)  \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
	x   \\
	y   \\
	z   \\
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
which leads to:
\begin{equation}
    \left.
    \begin{aligned}
	x_{tg}	&= -y	\\
	y_{tg}	&= x\cos\theta_0 + z\sin\theta_0    \\
	z_{tg}	&= -x\sin\theta_0 + z\cos\theta_0   \\
    \end{aligned}
    \right\}
    \iff
    \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
	x   &= y_{tg}\cos\theta_0 + z_{tg}\sin\theta_0	\\
	y   &= -x_{tg}	\\
	z   &= -y_{tg}\sin\theta_0 + z_{tg}\cos\theta_0   \\
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
\end{equation}
where $\theta_0$ is the scattering angle of the central ray in the lab frame.

The distance of an electron from the origin in both coordinate systems is:
\begin{equation}
    R = \left(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\right)^{1/2} = z_{tg} \left(\phi^2_{tg} + \theta^2_{tg} + 1\right)^{1/2}
\end{equation}
So the scattering angle in the lab frame will be:
\begin{equation}
    \cos\theta = \frac{z}{R} = \frac{-\phi_{tg}\sin\theta_0 + \cos\theta_0}{\left(\phi^2_{tg} + \theta^2_{tg} + 1\right)^{1/2}}
\end{equation}
For the data, $\theta_0$ is identified to be $4.789^\circ$ ($4.771^\circ$) for the
LHRS (RHRS). In the simulation, both arms use $4.74^\circ$. Note that $\theta_{\text{lab}}$
is a post-target (apparent) quantity, which includes effects from the 
post-vertex radiation and multi-scattering. It is not the `real' 
scattering angle (vertex quantity) at the vertex 
where the interesting PV elastic scattering happens. The correction from the apparent 
distribution to the vertex distribution is about 1.5\%.

To determine the new tune of the septum and HRS for CREX, we started with the
PREX-II tune by scaling it to the CREX momentum. To know the appropriate septum 
current that will bridge the central ray into the HRS axis, we tuned the septum and 
Q1 current in two steps: the coarse and fine tunes. The septum or Q1 current 
was changed by a large step of 10\% (the central ray search) in the coarse tune;
and then fine tuned in a smaller step of 2.5\% to find out
the largest acceptance (the inner edge search).

In the central ray search, if the septum current is inappropriate, 
the central hole in the reconstructed sieve pattern plot would shift when we 
change the Q1 current, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:central_ray_0}.

Fig. \ref{fig:central_ray_1} indicates that the nominal septum current and the 
nominal HRS setting is not a bad choice.
Then we moved on to the inner edge search to see more inner holes -- holes 
with the largest (smallest) $\phi$ in the left (right) arm.
It turns out a 5\% increment from the nominal value allows the largest 
acceptance, which corresponds to a septum current of: $1.05 \times (333*2.183522/0.95285) = 801.25$~A.

With the selected septum current, we continued to minimize the beam spot size

\subsection{Simulation}
The simulation is not an exact reproduction of the reality. We used GEANT4 to
simulate the geometry of each component based on the design values. The
septum magnetic field was scaled from a field map file sampled from the septum
with a current density of $j_0 = -1320\ \mathrm{A}/\mathrm{cm}^2$: % FIXME why?
% https://prex.jlab.org/DocDB/0001/000160/001/g4hrs_tune.pdf
\begin{equation}
    B'_{x,y,z} = \frac{j}{j_0} \times \frac{P}{P_0} \times B_{x,y,z}
    \label{eq:septum_current}
\end{equation}
where $j$ is the current density and $P$ being the electron momentum.

The same operation for the HRS field: % how to know HRS field at each position
\begin{equation}
    B'_{i = Q1, Q2, D, Q3} = \frac{P}{P_0} \times B_i
\end{equation}

With Eq.~\ref{eq:septum_current}, we could vary the septum current to find a value
at which the sieve pattern plot from simulation agrees with that from data,
then scanned through the collimator shift and the pinch point shift to select the 
best match between simulation and data, for various kinematic variables.

    \caption{Sieve plot of the CREX tune. Centered at (-0.3, -1.5), the new beam 
    position for the new target.}
\end{figure}

Somewhat expected, a coarse scan through the septum current showed that the 
proper range for best match with data was about 0-5\% above the nominal value,
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sim_septum_scan}.

With this narrow range, scan through the pinch point and collimator shift with a fine tune
of the septum current (from -1\% to +5\%). The pinch point is the connection point
between the septum beampipe and the upstream collimator box, whose misalignment will affect
the acceptance; the other parameter we can adjust is the collimator y position (in the transport
coordinate system),
which has a large impact on the acceptance. For each simulation, we
compared the average value of the scattering angle $\theta_{\text{lab}}$, $Q^2$ and asymmetry to
corresponding values from optics runs.

    }
    \label{fig:pinch_scan}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:pinch_scan}, when we shift the pinch point toward the
beam pipe (from negative values to positive values for the left arm, opposite for 
the right arm), the acceptance increases until the nominal value is reached, 
and then saturates. 
Similar trend is seen for shift in the Q1 collimator.

    \label{fig:best_model}
\end{figure}

Various corrections are applied to the simulation values, including the position
difference between the production target and the calibration target, which is
20~mm; and the correction caused by
the transportation matrix, whose optimization depends on the beam position.
\begin{equation}
    \phi_a = \phi_r + 0.5\ \text{mrad/mm} \times (x - x_0) + 0.5\ \text{mrad/mm} \times (y - y_0)
\end{equation}
where (x, y) is the actual beam position and ($x_0$, $y_0$) being the beam position
with which the transportation matrix is optimized. $\phi_a$ and $\phi_r$ refer
to the actual and reconstructed $\phi_{tg}$. 
An extra acceptance is added to the right arm to get a better match.

From Fig.~\ref{fig:best_model}, 
we selected the best model which has the smallest difference
between simulation and data in $\theta_{\text{lab}}$ and $Q^2$:
\begin{table}[!h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c | c c c c}

Check the best models against optics runs it terms of the distributions of
$\theta_{\text{lab}}$ and $Q^2$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:best_model_check}.
Quite good aggrements are achieved for both arms.
