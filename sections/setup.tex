\section{Design}
Though weak charge distribution is what we want to measure, it doesn't mean we
know nothing about it. Due to the symmetry between proton and neutron, we would
expect the weak charge (neutron) distribution is similar to the charge (proton)
distribution. Based on this assumption, we will have some models to describe
the neutron distribution and therefore the FFs, from which we can derive the
cross section and their asymmetry.

For symmetric nuclei with equal number of proton and neutron, it is expected 
that their density distributions are similar to each other, which are usually
expressed as a 2-parameter Fermi function:
\begin{equation}
    \rho(r) = \frac{\rho_0}{1 + exp(r-a)/c}
\end{equation}
where a and c denote the half-height radius and diffuseness respectively. 
% Thiel et al J.Phys.G 46 (2019) 9, 093003 

\subsection{Rate}
The scattering rate will be:
\begin{equation*}
    R(\theta) = 2\,I\,\rho\,t\,\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\,\frac{0.602}{A}\,a(\theta)
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{itemize}
    \item Factor of 2 for each spectrometer
    \item $\rho$ and t are target density and thickness
    \item A is atomic number
    \item 0.602 $\approx \frac{208-82}{208}$ ???
\end{itemize}
Total rate is:
\begin{equation*}
    R = 2\pi \int R(\theta)\sin(\theta)d\theta
\end{equation*}
The scattered flux rates on main integrating det. can be GHz level ($~$ 2.5 GHz / arm)

% To measure a ppm level quantaty to 5\% statistical uncertainty:
% $$ \frac{\sigma A}{A} = \frac{1}{A} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2N}} = 5\% \Rightarrow N \sim 10^{14} $$
% If we count scattered electrons one by one, at the rate of 2.5 GHz, it will take 
% $\frac{10^{14}}{2.5 \ MHz} \sim 10^8 \ s \sim 3 \ years$
% So we choose to integrate charge instead of counting electrons. But this requires
% a high degree of linearity in PMT and ADCs.



\begin{comment}
    The measured asymmetry will be:
    \begin{equation*}
	\CA = \frac{2\pi}{R} \int \CA_0(\theta)R(\theta)d\theta
    \end{equation*}

    Define sensitivity as:
    \begin{equation*}
	S(\theta) = \frac{|\CA_0(\theta) - \CA_1(\theta)|}{\CA_0(\theta)}
    \end{equation*}
    where $\CA_1$ is the asym. for 1\% change in radius. Then we can 
    calculate the total sensitivity:
    \begin{equation*}
	S = \frac{2\pi}{R} \int S(\theta)R(\theta)d\theta
    \end{equation*}

    For PREX-II: average sensitivity reduced by 5\% due to ${}^{12}C$ contamination
    For CREX: average sensitivity reduced by 10\% due to ${}^{40}Ca$ contamination
\end{comment}

\subsection{Sensitivity}
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\delta\CA}{\CA} = \sqrt{\sigma_{stat}^2 + \sigma_{sys}^2}
\end{equation*}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\sigma_{stat} = \left(\frac{\sigma_{det}}{P\sqrt{N}}\right) \frac{1}{A}$
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item $\sigma_{det} = \sqrt{1.06}$ is the det. error: $\sqrt{1.06}$ blowup to statistical err. due to det. resolution
	    \item P is the beam polarization
	    \item N is the number of electrons
	\end{itemize}
    \item $\sigma_{sys} = 2\% (1.25\%)$ for PREX (CREX)
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsubsection{Factor of 1.06}
    While a quartz Cerenkov detector is valued for radiation hardness and insensitivity to soft backgrounds, there is a particular challenge for few GeV electrons. In this energy range, shower fluctuations in a thick or radiated detector significantly degrade energy resolution, while photon statistics degrade the energy resolution for a thin detector. The energy resolution $\Delta E$ at nominal electron energy E increases the statistical error that one would have with infinite resolution $\sigma_0$ to obtain the total statistical error:
$$ \sigma = \sigma_0\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\Delta E}{E}\right)^2}$$
    
Based on experience in the PREX experiment, we expect an reduction of statistical precision of a factor of 1.06 due to detector resolution.

\bigskip
Radius error:
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\delta R_n}{R_n} = \frac{\delta \CA}{\CA}\frac{1}{\epsilon}
\end{equation*}
minimizing $\delta R_n/R_n$ means to minimize $\delta \CA/\CA$ and maximize $\epsilon$. 

Given $\delta_{\text{sys}}$, minimizing $\delta\CA/\CA$ means to minimize $\sigma_{\text{stat}}$

Given $\sigma_{\text{det}}$ and P, this means to maximize $\CA \times \sqrt{N}$

So, we define FOM as:
\begin{equation*}
    \text{FOM} = R \times \CA^2 \times \epsilon^2
\end{equation*}
Note here R is the scattering rate, $\epsilon = \frac{dA/A}{dR_n/R_n}$ is the sensitivity of the asymmetry for a small change in $R_n$.

\bigskip
Using HRS of Hall A, a \textbf{small} scattering angle maximizes the FOM. 
Given practical constraints on how low an angle ($4^\circ$) we can reach with 
septum magnets, the energy is fixed and turns out to be 2.2 GeV, which is a 
natural 1-pass beam energy for CEBAF operations in the 12 GeV era.

    follows either A or C} 
\end{figure}
With the 12 GeV upgrade, the north and south LINAC each has 25 cryomodules, 
capable of accelrating electrons at the rate of 2.2 $GeV/turn$. The special
design of CEBAF allows it to deliver electron beams of different energies to
3 (4) halls simultaneously, as long as the total beam power is less than 1 MW.
So different nuclear experiments can be carried out in different halls at the 
same time.

\section{Polarized Electron Source}
% The key to the success of this experiment was the 1975 discovery of a new method for producing
% polarized electrons made by a group in Colorado, which included E.L. Garwin of SLAC.
% Shortly thereafter, a new source was built for the SLAC linac utilizing the method, thus
% allowing for the 1978 parity violation measurements which were in close agreement with
% those predicted by the GWS model. 
PVES experiments motivate the development of polarized electron source, which 
require a highly stable polarized electron source that can produce
high polarization electron beam at a wide range of intensity, from nA to A 
depending on the experiment. The source should be capable of rapid helicity
reversal ($\sim 100 Hz$) with negligible impact on other properties of the beam.

Currently, GaAs-based semiconductor photoemission source is % confirmed by Wang Yan
the only available polarized electron source for accelerators on the market.
Historically, this 
kind of electron source was the only one that could satisfy high peak currents 
required by the low duty factors of the old accelerators and rapid helicity 
reversal required by PVES. That's why it is the only player on the market now.
Over the past few decades, pulsed beam has been replaced by continuous beam while
this electron source is inheritated and further developed. The polarized electron
source used by CEBAF can produce electron beam with polarization greater than
85\%, much larger than the 37\% polarization from its inauguration at SLAC. \cite{PRESCOTT1978347}

The design was first proposed independently by Garwin, Pierce and Siegmann \cite{GARWIN}
and by Lampel and Weisbuch \cite{LAMPEL1975877}. The idea is straightforward:
When circularly polarized laser light with carefully selected energy $E_{gap} < h\nu < E_{gap} + \Delta$
shoot on the semiconductor, only electrons on the valance band $P_{3/2}$ will be
pumped into the conduction band $S_{1/2}$. The selection rule makes sure only
those transitions that satisfy $\Delta m_j = +1 \ (-1)$ can occur for circularly
right (left) incoming photons, As shown in fig. \ref{fig:excitation-b}.
The ratio of the transition rate is also marked out in circle in the plot, 
which can be calculated from the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient easily. The excited
electrons are polarzied and different states have different pumping rate, so
we have polarized electron beam now with polarization as: P = (3-1)/(3+1) = 50\%,
for both cases.

\end{figure}
Then how can we liberate the polarzied electrons from the material, without 
degenerating the polarization significantly. As shown in fig. \ref{fig:PEA},
for bare GaAs, a $4.07 ev$ electron affinity (EA) prevents any electrons from
leaving the surface. To solve this problem, a condition known as negative
electron affinity (NEA) is used, that is to make the energy of electron in 
the vaccum just outside the surface lower than the conduction band energy by
adding a layer a cesium oxide on the surface of pure GaAs semiconductor.

By the NEA technique, we were able to get polarized electron beam, but never
reached the ideal 50\% polarization, achieved polarization range between 25 to 43\%
. The polarization loss is due to spin dilution as electrons diffuse to the 
semiconductor surface. From this aspect, we can increase the polarization by 
reducing the thickness of the GaAs crystal. But obviously, even the thinnest
GaAs crystal can't give us a polarization greater than 50\%. New strategies 
are needed. It turned out the answer was strained GaAs. \cite{CARDMAN1992317}

With a strained layer, the degeneracy of $P_{3/2}$ state is splitted, 
only states with $m_j = \pm 3/2$ will be pumped, therefore we will get 100\% 
polarization, in ideal case. The real polaration achieved by CEBAF electron
source is about 88\%.

\section{Polarization Control}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Helicity Correlated Beam Asymmetry (HCBA) is the most largest false
	asymmetry to the parity-violating asymmetry
    \item It arises from the beam difference (intensity, position ...) between two helicity states from the injector
    \item A well-control of the electron source configuration can help suppress the effect of HCBA
    \item The dominant part is the Polarization Induced Transport Asymmetry (PITA) effect

\begin{comment}
    1. what's the beam polarization before the Pockels cell? linearly or circularly
    polarized?
\end{comment}

The following components in the injector help to control the beam polarization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Intensity Attenuator (IA): equalize beam intensity acroos helicity states
    \item Insertable Half-Wave Plate (IHWP): slow control, flip circular polarization
    \item Pockels Cell (PC): based on Pockels effect, reversing the voltage reverses
	the birefringence of the crystal and therefore the helicity
    \item Rotatable Half-Wave Plate (RHWP): equalized any residual linear polarization,
	establish a QE independent of helicity
    \item Two Wien filters (vertical and horizontal) and solenoid magnets are 
	used to set the spin alignment so that the electron spin is longitudinal 
	at the target
\end{itemize}

To first order:

    \CA_{I} = \frac{I^R - I^L}{I^R + I^L} = -\frac{\epsilon}{T}[\Delta\cos(2\theta)]	\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Delta$: antisymmetric offset phase shift in PC
    \item $\epsilon/T \ (<<1)$: ``analyzing power'', $\epsilon = T_{x'} - T_{y'}$ $T = T_{x'} + T_{y'}$
    \item $\theta$: the angle between the PC's fast axis and the $x'$ transmission axis of the downstream analyzer
\end{itemize}

Considering other optical components downstream the PC:
\begin{equation*}
    \CA_{I} = -\frac{\epsilon}{T}[\cos(2\theta) \cdot (\Delta - \Delta^0)]
\end{equation*}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Delta^0$: offset phase shift introduced by residual birefringence in the PC and other optical components

\section{Beam Modulation}
It is very important for PVES to control the systematic uncertainty, especially
the one from beam fluctuation (HCBA). Ideally, the electrons bunches with opposite
polarization should have exactly the same internsity and energy, hitting the target 
at the same place with the same angle, which is obviously impossible in reality. 
So we need to correct the false asymmetry introduce by the beam fluctuation. There are a
few methods to do the correction, one of them is the so called Beam modulation.
The idea is to introduce man-made fluctuations to the beam through the 
modulation system, then we can measure the changes in monitors and detectors 
to find the sensitivities of detectors to changes in energy, position and angle,
which will be used to correct the measured asymmetry.

The beam modulcation system lies in Beam Switch Yard area right after existing 
the CEBAF, it consists of 7 air-core coils and an energy vernier, the total 
number of 8 coils provides a redudancy w.r.t. the free number of degrees 
of beam phase space, making sure to cover all beam phase space at target.  
These coils (vernier) are driven by a VME-DAC, which in turns is controlled by the parity DAQ.
It takes 4.267 s for each coil (vernier) to modulate the beam, a whole 
modulation cycle takes $85.68 \ s$ ($\sim 1$ beam modulation every 10 mins in
data taking). For the position and angle modulation, the beam diplacement will
be $0.3-0.5\ \mu m$ and energy vernier will result in a beam diplacement of $0.75 \ mm$

\section{Polarimeters}
We have 2 polarimeters to measure the polarization: the Compton polarimeter and
the Moller polarimeter. While being more accurate, the Moller polarimeter makes
invasive measurement, so we rely on the less accurate but non-invasive Compton
polarimeter for daily monitor of the beam polarization.

\subsection{Compton Polarimeter}
The Compton polarimeter is non-invaisve, therefore it
operates all the time along data taking to monitor the beam polarization. The
Compton polarimeter locates at the entrance to hall A (about 20 m upstream the 
target chamber), using the elastic scatter between polarized photon and electron
to measured the polarization of the electron beam. As shown in fig \ref{fig:compton_pol},
when the compton polarimeter is on, the electron beam will be bent into the 
Compton chicane to interact with the polarized photons. The photon energy is 
2.33 eV and the crossing angle is $23.5^\circ$. The scattered photons will be
detected by the photon detector right of the interaction region, while the
electron beam will be bent back to the beam pipe to bombar the target. Due to
interaction with photons, the scattered electrons will be less energetic than
the incoming ones. So under the same dipole field, the scattered electrons will
be bent more than the non-interacting ones, as shown by the red dash line. This 
seperation allow us to measure the scattered electrons, together with measurement
of scattered photons, we can identify and scattering asymmetry and then the polarization
of the electron beam.
\begin{equation*}
    \CA_{\text{th}} = \frac{\sigma_{\Rightarrow}^{R} - \sigma_{\Rightarrow}^{L}}{\sigma_{\Rightarrow}^{R} + \sigma_{\Rightarrow}^{L}}  \qquad
    \CA_{\text{exp}} = \CP_{e}\CP_{\gamma}\CA_{\text{th}} = \frac{N_{\gamma}^R - N_{\gamma}^L}{N_{\gamma}^R + N_{\gamma}^L}
\end{equation*}
The Compoton polarimeter is able to achieve a 1\% overall absolute systemtatic
uncertainty.

    \caption{Left: Compton chicane; Right: Schematic plot of electron/photon 
    scattering} 
    \label{fig:compton_pol}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Moller Polarimeter}
The Moller polarimeter uses elastic electron-electron scattering to measure the
asymmetry due to different beam polarizations. Since this is a pure QED process,
its cross section is well understood and easily calculable to high order:
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \left( \frac{d\sigma_0}{d\Omega} \right) [ 1 + P_b \cdot P_t \cdot A_{ZZ}(\theta)]
\end{equation*}
Where $\frac{d\sigma_0}{d\Omega} = \left( \frac{\alpha(4 - \sin^2\theta)}{2m_e\gamma\sin^2\theta }\right)^2$ is the unpolarized cross section and $A_{zz}(\theta)$ is the analyzing power, 
in CoM frame, $A_zz(\theta) = -\sin^2\theta \frac{8 - \sin^2\theta}{(4-\sin^2\theta)^2}$.
When $\theta_{CoM} = 90^\circ$, $A_{zz}$ is maximized to be $-\frac{7}{9}$.
$P_b (P_t)$ is the polarization of beam (target). The polarized target electrons
are provided by magnetized Fe-alloy foil, a strong (FIXME: how much) magnetic 
field is required to polarized the target electrons. The scattered electrons will
be separated by quadrupole or septum magnet, and then collected by electron 
detectors. Because Moller measurement is invasive, it happens about every 10 days.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Target}
As tiny as the neutron skin thickness, to measure it relatively accurate, the
larger it is, the better our measurement will be. So the target elements should
have a large neutron excess. So \Pb (\Ca) is chosed for PREX-II (CREX). Some
bonus from the choice are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Both are doubly-magic nuclei, which means they are stable than their
	isotope
    \item They are spin-0, no need to worry about the target polarization
    \item Their first inelastic states are large, 2.6 MeV for \Ca, which helps
	to reduce background from inelastic scattering
    \item Both are heavy nuclei, which reduces recoiling effect and help
	to achive low $Q^2$
\end{itemize}

In addition to the production targets, we had other targets to ensure our 
understanding of the spectrometer optics. For example, we have Carbon Hole target
to identify the beam position; there is Carbon target to measure the scattering
rate of \C. A water target in the $45^\circ$ ladder helps to calibrate the 
scattering angle, etc.

\section{Septum}
The septum magnet is required to bridge the scattered electrons at small angle
into the HRS. As said before, the designed scattering angle is about $5^\circ$
while the smallest angle that HRS can reach is $12.5^\circ$, so we need the septum
magnet to guide the scattered electrons into HRS. 

The septum consists of 3 coils, by applying large current, it will produce a
strong magnetic field (up to $\sim 1 \ T$ in the central region). A septum beampipe
will connect the upstream collimator box and the downstream HRS vacuum pipe.

\section{High Resolution Spectrometer (HRS)}
As its names implies, the high resolution capability of the spectrometer helps
us to reject most of inelastic electrons, leaving us a relative clean data with
very small background from inelastic scattering. The HRS consists of 3 quadrupoles 
and one dipole in each arm, the quadrupoles magnetic field is around $0.2 \ T$,
while the dipole magnetic field will reach as high as $0.4 \ T$.
the collimator at the Q1 entrance defines the acceptance shape.
