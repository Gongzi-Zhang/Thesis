\subsection{Design}
Though weak charge distribution is what we want to measure, it doesn't mean we
know nothing about it. Due to the symmetry between proton and neutron, we would
expect the weak charge (neutron) distribution is similar to the charge (proton)
distribution. Based on this assumption, we will have some models to describe
the neutron distribution and therefore the FFs, from which we can derive the
cross section and their asymmetry.

With the 12 GeV upgrade, the north and south LINAC each has 25 cryomodules, 
capable of accelrating electrons at the rate of 2.2 $GeV/turn$. The total power
of CEBAF (FIXME: how much) limits the available beam current. For PREX-II (CREX), 
the beam current was 70 (150) $\mu A$ respectively.
