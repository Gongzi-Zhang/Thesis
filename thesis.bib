    abstract = {The coefficients of different mass formulae derived from the liquid drop model and including or not the curvature energy, the diffuseness correction to the Coulomb energy, the charge exchange correction term, different forms of the Wigner term and different powers of the relative neutron excess I=(N−Z)/A have been determined by a least square fitting procedure to 2027 experimental atomic masses. The Coulomb diffuseness correction Z2/A term or the charge exchange correction Z4/3/A1/3 term plays the main role to improve the accuracy of the mass formula. The Wigner term and the curvature energy can also be used separately for the same purpose. The introduction of an |I| dependence in the surface and volume energies improves slightly the efficiency of the expansion and is more effective than an I4 dependence. Different expressions reproducing the experimental nuclear charge radius are provided. The different fits lead to a surface energy coefficient of around 17–18 MeV and a relative equivalent rms charge radius r0 of 1.22–1.23 fm.}

It presents an updated set of rms charge radii for 909 isotopes of 92 elements from 1H to 96Cm together, when available, with the radii changes from optical isotope shifts. Compared with the last published tables of R-values from 2004 (799 ground states), many new data are added due to progress recently achieved by laser spectroscopy up to early 2011. The radii changes in isotopic chains for He, Li, Be, Ne, Sc, Mn, Y, Nb, Bi have been first obtained in the last years and several isotopic sequences have been recently extended to regions far off stability, (e.g., Ar, Mo, Sn, Te, Pb, Po).}

The ratio of π− to π+ reaction cross sections has been analysed in terms of neutron density distributions using the Watson multiple-scattering theory. The effects of second-order contributions and of the various choices of wave equation have been considered. It is found that the distributions of neutrons and protons in heavy nuclei must have very similar radial parameters. Good agreement is obtained between the measured and calculated values for the reaction cross sections, without any adjustment of parameters.}

The results of the calculations obtained for various even-even nuclei such as 16-28O, 40-58Ca, 100-120Sn, and 182-218Pb show that the PDR is significantly enhanced when the number of neutrons outside the stable core of the nucleus is increased, that is, in the neutron-rich nuclei. As the result, the relative ratio between the energy weighted sum of the strength of the PDR and that of the GDR (giant dipole resonance) does not exceed 4%. The collectivity of the PDR and GDR states will be also discussed.}

A promising nuclear observable in order to constrain the density dependence of the symmetry energy at saturation is the neutron skin thickness of medium and heavy nuclei. Recently, a low-energy peak in the isovector dipole response of neutron-rich nuclei has been discovered that may be correlated with the neutron skin thickness. The existence of this correlation is currently under debate due to our limited experimental knowledge on the microscopic structure of such a peak. We present a detailed analysis of Skyrme Hartree-Fock (HF) plus random phase approximation (RPA) predictions for the dipole response in several neutron-rich nuclei and try to elucidate whether models of common use in nuclear physics confirm or dismiss its possible connection with the neutron skin thickness. Finally, we briefly present theoretical results for parity violating electron scattering on 208Pb at the conditions of the PREx experiment and discuss the implications for the neutron skin thickness of 208Pb and the slope of the symmetry energy.}

    ABSTRACT={In this review, we concentrate on recent efforts of our group aimed at investigating the nuclear equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter (equal concentrations of protons and neutrons) and the one of pure neutron matter. Although idealized, these systems are suitable “laboratories" to probe nuclear forces in the many-body system. The energy per particle as a function of density can reveal rich information about the nature of nuclear forces in the medium and how they impact observable properties. For instance, the pressure in neutron-rich matter has been found to have profound impact on very diverse systems, ranging from the thickness of the neutron skin in a heavy nucleus to the properties of compact stars. The current trend in nuclear physics is to build few-nucleon forces according to the prescription of chiral effective field theory. We open by reviewing in depth how we develop equations of state based on state-of-the-art chiral interactions. We then highlight some applications in neutron-rich nuclei and neutron stars.}

    abstract = {In the discussion before the Royal Society on the constitution of the atomic nucleus held on February 7, 1929,* I proposed a simple model of a nucleus built from α-particles in a way very similar to a water-drop held together by surface tension. A certain number of protons (not more than three) and electrons can be bound to such an α-aggregate without forming a new α-particle. † Such additional units of nuclear constitution, usually bound less strongly than those involved in the α-particles, we shall term free nuclear protons and electrons. Their presence will, of course, affect the form of the nuclear energy curve (mass defect curve), not changing, however, its general shape. In the present paper I shall attempt to treat the problem more closely, analysing from the theoretical point of view the experimental facts concerning the nuclear energy.},

Although the electric charge distributions in atomic nuclei were measured accurately already half a century ago, our knowledge of the distribution of neutrons is still deficient. In addition to constraining the size of atomic nuclei, the neutron distribution also impacts the number of nuclei that can exist and the size of neutron stars. We present an ab initio calculation of the neutron distribution of the neutron-rich nucleus 48Ca. We show that the neutron skin (difference between the radii of the neutron and proton distributions) is significantly smaller than previously thought. We also make predictions for the electric dipole polarizability and the weak form factor; both quantities that are at present targeted by precision measurements. Based on ab initio results for 48Ca, we provide a constraint on the size of a neutron star.},

After correction for finite electron polarization and background we deduce an experimental asymmetry of Acx = $(-9.4 \pm 1.8 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{-6}$. The quoted errors indicate the statistical and the systematic uncertainties, respectively. The asymmetry, which is dominated by the quasielastic cross section, is interpreted in terms of model-independent electron-nucleon coupling constants of the weak neutral current. The error limits in the sector of axial vector coupling constants have been improved by a factor of 3 over previous results. A model-dependent analysis for the Weinberg angle yields the result $\sin^2\theta_w = 0.221 \pm 0.014 \pm 0.004$.}

Each chamber has an inherent per-plane resolution for 5-cell cosmic-ray tracks of 145μm FWHM when operated on the bench at −4.8kV with argon–isobutane gas, and 225μm FWHM for 5-cell electron tracks when operated in the High-Resolution Spectrometer detector stack at −4.0kV with argon–ethane gas. The design and construction facilitates wire placement and replacement to 50μm, very low dark current, and no cross-talk. The detectors have been in almost continuous use since April 1996, providing reliable, high-resolution charged-particle tracking data for the Hall A physics program.

    journal = {Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics},
    abstract = {The complex nature of the nuclear forces generates a broad range and diversity of observational phenomena. Heavy nuclei, though orders of magnitude less massive than neutron stars, are governed by the same underlying physics, which is enshrined in the nuclear equation of state. Heavy nuclei are expected to develop a neutron-rich skin where many neutrons collect near the surface. The thickness of this skin is strongly sensitive to the poorly-known density dependence of the symmetry energy near saturation density. An accurate and model-independent determination of the neutron-skin thickness of heavy nuclei would provide a significant first constraint on the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. The determination of the neutron-skin thickness of heavy nuclei has far reaching consequences in many areas of physics as diverse as heavy-ion collisions, polarized electron and proton scattering off nuclei, precision tests of the standard model using atomic parity violation, and nuclear astrophysics. While a systematic and concerted experimental effort has been made to measure the neutron-skin thickness of heavy nuclei, a precise and model-independent determination remains elusive. The measurement of parity-violating asymmetries provides a clean and model-independent determination of the weak form factor of the nucleus which is dominated by the neutron distribution. However, measuring parity-violating asymmetries of the order of a part per million is both challenging and time-consuming. Alternative observables sensitive to the symmetry energy have been proposed and measured successfully in recent experimental campaigns. These data are valuable, but interpretations contain implicit model dependence that hinder the clean determination of the neutron-skin thickness. How to move forward at a time when many new facilities are being commissioned and how to strengthen the synergy with other areas of physics are primary goals of this review.}

    abstract = {The structure of neutron stars is considered from theoretical and observational perspectives. We demonstrate an important aspect of neutron star structure: the neutron star radius is primarily determined by the behavior of the pressure of matter in the vicinity of nuclear matter equilibrium density. In the event that extreme softening does not occur at these densities, the radius is virtually independent of the mass and is determined by the magnitude of the pressure. For equations of state with extreme softening or those that are self-bound, the radius is more sensitive to the mass. Our results show that in the absence of extreme softening, a measurement of the radius of a neutron star more accurate than about 1 km will usefully constrain the equation of state. We also show that the pressure near nuclear matter density is primarily a function of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, while the nuclear incompressibility and skewness parameters play secondary roles. In addition, we show that the moment of inertia and the binding energy of neutron stars, for a large class of equations of state, are nearly universal functions of the star's compactness. These features can be understood by considering two analytic, yet realistic, solutions of Einstein's equations, by, respectively, Buchdahl and Tolman. We deduce useful approximations for the fraction of the moment of inertia residing in the crust, which is a function of the stellar compactness and, in addition, the pressure at the core-crust interface.}

    abstract={Urca-processes were introduced into astrophysics by Gamow and Schoenberg in 1941. Neutrino cooling resulting from urca-processes plays an important role at the latest stages of evolution of massive stars. Recent work on neutrino emissivity of dense matter shows that neutrino cooling via urca-processes could determine the thermal evolution of young neutron stars and depends dramatically on the composition of the neutron star core. In particular, if a neutron star contains a central core in which the ``direct urca-process'' is operative, the cooling timescale shortens by many orders of magnitude.},

    abstract={We describe the research and development work for the P2 experiment which aims for a high precision determination of the weak mixing angle {\$}{\backslash}sin^{\{}2{\}}{\backslash}theta{\_}{\{}W{\}}{\$} to a precision of 0.15{\%} at a four-momentum transfer of {\$}4.5{\backslash}times 10^{\{}-3{\}}{\$} GeV2. This accuracy, comparable to existing measurements at the Z pole, allows for a sensitive test of the Standard Model up to a mass scale of 50 TeV, extendable to 60 TeV. The weak mixing angle is connected to the weak charge of the proton which will be extracted from a measurement of the parity violating cross section asymmetry {\$}-39.94 {\backslash}times 10^{\{}-9{\}}{\$} in elastic electron-proton scattering. A total accuracy of {\$}0.57 {\backslash}times 10^{\{}-9{\}}{\$} is achievable in a measurement time of 11000 h using a 150$\mu$A polarized electron beam impinging on a 60 cm liquid hydrogen target. The P2 asymmetry is smaller than any asymmetry measured so far in electron scattering with an unprecedented goal for the accuracy. The use of a solenoid spectrometer with 100{\%} {\$}{\backslash}phi{\$}-acceptance as well as an atomic hydrogen trap polarimeter are new features, which have never before been used in parity-violation experiments. In order to collect the enormous statistics required for this measurement, the new Mainz Energy-Recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA) is under construction. Plans for the associated beam control system and the polarimetry are described in this article as well. A liquid hydrogen high-power target with an extremely low noise level of 10 ppm needs to be designed and constructed. We report in addition on the conceptual design of the P2 spectrometer, its Cherenkov detectors, the integrating read-out electronics as well as the ultra-thin, fast tracking detectors. The physics program of the MESA facility comprises indirect, high precision search for physics beyond the Standard Model, measurement of the neutron distribution in nuclear physics, single-spin asymmetries, and a possible future extension to the measurement of hadronic parity violation.},

    abstract = {Bulk nuclear observables such as charge radii and binding energies are well described by both nonrelativistic and covariant mean-field models. However, predictions of neutron radii, which are not tightly constrained by reliable data, vary significantly. The nature of this variation is investigated using correlations between basic properties of the models and the neutron skin thickness in lead. The results suggest that conventional covariant models are too limited. The study is guided by principles and insights of effective field theory (EFT), such as power counting, and the relation of mean-field models to a more general EFT approach to nuclei is discussed.}
