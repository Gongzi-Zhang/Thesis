    title = {Neutron skins of atomic nuclei: per aspera ad astra},
    journal = {Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics},
    abstract = {The complex nature of the nuclear forces generates a broad range and diversity of observational phenomena. Heavy nuclei, though orders of magnitude less massive than neutron stars, are governed by the same underlying physics, which is enshrined in the nuclear equation of state. Heavy nuclei are expected to develop a neutron-rich skin where many neutrons collect near the surface. The thickness of this skin is strongly sensitive to the poorly-known density dependence of the symmetry energy near saturation density. An accurate and model-independent determination of the neutron-skin thickness of heavy nuclei would provide a significant first constraint on the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. The determination of the neutron-skin thickness of heavy nuclei has far reaching consequences in many areas of physics as diverse as heavy-ion collisions, polarized electron and proton scattering off nuclei, precision tests of the standard model using atomic parity violation, and nuclear astrophysics. While a systematic and concerted experimental effort has been made to measure the neutron-skin thickness of heavy nuclei, a precise and model-independent determination remains elusive. The measurement of parity-violating asymmetries provides a clean and model-independent determination of the weak form factor of the nucleus which is dominated by the neutron distribution. However, measuring parity-violating asymmetries of the order of a part per million is both challenging and time-consuming. Alternative observables sensitive to the symmetry energy have been proposed and measured successfully in recent experimental campaigns. These data are valuable, but interpretations contain implicit model dependence that hinder the clean determination of the neutron-skin thickness. How to move forward at a time when many new facilities are being commissioned and how to strengthen the synergy with other areas of physics are primary goals of this review.}

    abstract = {The present table contains experimental root-mean-square (rms) nuclear charge radii R obtained by combined analysis of two types of experimental data: (i) radii changes determined from optical and, to a lesser extent, Kα X-ray isotope shifts and (ii) absolute radii measured by muonic spectra and electronic scattering experiments. The table combines the results of two working groups, using respectively two different methods of evaluation, published in ADNDT earlier. It presents an updated set of rms charge radii for 909 isotopes of 92 elements from 1H to 96Cm together, when available, with the radii changes from optical isotope shifts. Compared with the last published tables of R-values from 2004 (799 ground states), many new data are added due to progress recently achieved by laser spectroscopy up to early 2011. The radii changes in isotopic chains for He, Li, Be, Ne, Sc, Mn, Y, Nb, Bi have been first obtained in the last years and several isotopic sequences have been recently extended to regions far off stability, (e.g., Ar, Mo, Sn, Te, Pb, Po).}

Numerous experimental results for optical isotope shifts have been published elsewhere; for eight elements the relevant information is condensed ("projected") here to one optical line per element. A model-independent analysis which combines data from all three experimental methods is applied to these elements and is presented as an illustration of the improved accuracy for the rms radii and Barrett radii which result from this analysis.}

    journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
    abstract = {The structure of neutron stars is considered from theoretical and observational perspectives. We demonstrate an important aspect of neutron star structure: the neutron star radius is primarily determined by the behavior of the pressure of matter in the vicinity of nuclear matter equilibrium density. In the event that extreme softening does not occur at these densities, the radius is virtually independent of the mass and is determined by the magnitude of the pressure. For equations of state with extreme softening or those that are self-bound, the radius is more sensitive to the mass. Our results show that in the absence of extreme softening, a measurement of the radius of a neutron star more accurate than about 1 km will usefully constrain the equation of state. We also show that the pressure near nuclear matter density is primarily a function of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, while the nuclear incompressibility and skewness parameters play secondary roles. In addition, we show that the moment of inertia and the binding energy of neutron stars, for a large class of equations of state, are nearly universal functions of the star's compactness. These features can be understood by considering two analytic, yet realistic, solutions of Einstein's equations, by, respectively, Buchdahl and Tolman. We deduce useful approximations for the fraction of the moment of inertia residing in the crust, which is a function of the stellar compactness and, in addition, the pressure at the core-crust interface.}

We review the status of these sources, with emphasis on those best suited for accelerator applications.}
