    title = {Neutron skins of atomic nuclei: per aspera ad astra},
    journal = {Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics},
    abstract = {The complex nature of the nuclear forces generates a broad range and diversity of observational phenomena. Heavy nuclei, though orders of magnitude less massive than neutron stars, are governed by the same underlying physics, which is enshrined in the nuclear equation of state. Heavy nuclei are expected to develop a neutron-rich skin where many neutrons collect near the surface. The thickness of this skin is strongly sensitive to the poorly-known density dependence of the symmetry energy near saturation density. An accurate and model-independent determination of the neutron-skin thickness of heavy nuclei would provide a significant first constraint on the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. The determination of the neutron-skin thickness of heavy nuclei has far reaching consequences in many areas of physics as diverse as heavy-ion collisions, polarized electron and proton scattering off nuclei, precision tests of the standard model using atomic parity violation, and nuclear astrophysics. While a systematic and concerted experimental effort has been made to measure the neutron-skin thickness of heavy nuclei, a precise and model-independent determination remains elusive. The measurement of parity-violating asymmetries provides a clean and model-independent determination of the weak form factor of the nucleus which is dominated by the neutron distribution. However, measuring parity-violating asymmetries of the order of a part per million is both challenging and time-consuming. Alternative observables sensitive to the symmetry energy have been proposed and measured successfully in recent experimental campaigns. These data are valuable, but interpretations contain implicit model dependence that hinder the clean determination of the neutron-skin thickness. How to move forward at a time when many new facilities are being commissioned and how to strengthen the synergy with other areas of physics are primary goals of this review.}

The radii changes in isotopic chains for He, Li, Be, Ne, Sc, Mn, Y, Nb, Bi have been first obtained in the last years and several isotopic sequences have been recently extended to regions far off stability, (e.g., Ar, Mo, Sn, Te, Pb, Po).}

    abstract = {The structure of neutron stars is considered from theoretical and observational perspectives. We demonstrate an important aspect of neutron star structure: the neutron star radius is primarily determined by the behavior of the pressure of matter in the vicinity of nuclear matter equilibrium density. In the event that extreme softening does not occur at these densities, the radius is virtually independent of the mass and is determined by the magnitude of the pressure. For equations of state with extreme softening or those that are self-bound, the radius is more sensitive to the mass. Our results show that in the absence of extreme softening, a measurement of the radius of a neutron star more accurate than about 1 km will usefully constrain the equation of state. We also show that the pressure near nuclear matter density is primarily a function of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, while the nuclear incompressibility and skewness parameters play secondary roles. In addition, we show that the moment of inertia and the binding energy of neutron stars, for a large class of equations of state, are nearly universal functions of the star's compactness. These features can be understood by considering two analytic, yet realistic, solutions of Einstein's equations, by, respectively, Buchdahl and Tolman. We deduce useful approximations for the fraction of the moment of inertia residing in the crust, which is a function of the stellar compactness and, in addition, the pressure at the core-crust interface.}

Wherever possible, connections and constraints between the data were applied to make the data system consistent. Based on the resulting data set, the smooth global structure of the radius surface R(N,Z) was investigated by fitting simple empirical functions to the intersections with constant Z and N as well as with constant A plains. The simple behavior of the surface rendered it possible to apply a simple model, the two-liquid drop model to reproduce the main tendencies, and to predict the existence of a indentation along the line of stability on the radius surface. This indentation suggests a decrease of average nucleon density away from stability. The fine structure in the mass number dependence of rms charge radii is briefly presented.}

After correction for finite electron polarization and background we deduce an experimental asymmetry of Acx = $(-9.4 \pm 1.8 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{-6}$.

    abstract = {Events induced by neutral particles and producing only hadrons, but no muon or electron, have been observed in the heavy liquid bubble chamber Gargamelle exposed to neutrino (v) and antineutrino (v) beams at CERN. A study of the various sources which could give rise to such events reveals that less than 20% could be attributed to neutrons or KL°. The events behave as expected if they arise from neutral current processes induced by neutrinos and antineutrinos. The ratio of the number of these events to the number of corresponding events with charged lepton is 0.22 ± 0.04 for v and 0.43 ± 0.12 for v.}
